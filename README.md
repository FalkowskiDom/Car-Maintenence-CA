When running, the error cannot delete the children's folder 
Delete the build folder and press run again. If no error occurs code should run without errors

As for my ai convo i couldnt upload the convo as i kept getting and error so the only way that I could send you the conversation was by an invite link to a groupchat on chatgpt with that convo in it 
you can find this link in my Ca-self assesment form along side all my sources
