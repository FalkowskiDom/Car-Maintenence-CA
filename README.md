README

AI was used in this project but not to generate code, but for debugging, helping to fix errors, and formatting.
Had many issues with persistence and overall issues like the app crashing or just refusing to launch.
Also had many issues with layout as text was sitting on one another and reminders were spawning at the top of the screen on top of the text box, or just wouldnâ€™t display at all but there were no errors in the code 
When running, the error cannot delete the children's folder 
Delete the build folder and press run again. If no error occurs code should run without errors
